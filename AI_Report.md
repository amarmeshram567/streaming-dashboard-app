## 1. Project Objective

The Streaming Dashboard Clone is a simplified streaming service dashboard inspired by platforms like Netflix and Hulu.  
The app features:

- **Hero Banner:** Displays featured content prominently.  
- **Horizontal Movie Rows:** Scrollable rows for popular, trending, or categorized movies.  
- **Movie Detail Pages:** Detailed view for each movie with title, overview, release date, and genres.  
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search movies directly in the app without leaving the page.  

The main goal was to build a fully responsive, performant, and deployable Next.js 14 + TypeScript application using Tailwind CSS.

## 2. AI Assistance Summary

During the development, AI tools (ChatGPT) were utilized for guidance and code generation in the following areas:

### Project Planning
- Suggested step-by-step project structure and implementation plan.  
- Recommended **Next.js 14 App Router** architecture.  
- Provided folder structure and naming conventions.

### Code Generation
- Created components like `Header`, `Footer`, `HeroBanner`, `MovieRow`, `MovieCard`.  
- Generated **TypeScript interfaces** for movie and API data.  
- Developed TMDB API helper functions (`fetchPopular`, `fetchMovieById`).  
- Built **search modal** with client-side functionality for movies.  

### Styling & Tailwind CSS
- Suggested **custom CSS variables** for dark theme and color consistency.  
- Added utility classes like scrollbar hiding, gradient overlays, and text shadows.  
- Implemented **responsive navigation** and **mobile sidebar**.  

### Debugging & Deployment Assistance
- Guided setup for environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY`) in Vercel.  
- Provided step-by-step instructions for deployment and troubleshooting.  

### Documentation
- Drafted `README.md` with setup, run, and deployment instructions.  
- Created this **AI usage report** to document AI contributions.
